1) LEA ID(s), School ID(s), School Name(s) reported by OSSE via School and Lea Information Management System file (SLIMS).
2) School addresses and former DCPS facility names were verified by DME and PCSB.
3) Maximum occupancy numbers and total square footage numbers reported by PSCB. This information is collected through charter school facilities' Certificate of Occupancy (C of O), which charter schools are required to submit to PCSB in October if one is not already on file. PCSB then follows up with any missing charter facility C's of O between October-February of each year.  The maximum occupancy count number describes how many people can legally occupy the building stated on the facility's C of O.
