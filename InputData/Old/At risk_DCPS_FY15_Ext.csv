,"Notes: The FY15 at-risk projected enrollment was calculated at the LEA level. School-level at-risk shares are provided in this table but school-level at risk numbers will not calculate exactly to the total number of projected at risk students due to rounding.

Alternative and adult schools have no projected at-risk students because at-risk funding is not applied to alternative and adult students. Those LEAs have ""na"" or not applicable.
