,Notes: This appendix is organized at the building level and lists multiple addresses for each school's unique ID defined by OSSE's School and LEA Infromation Management System (SLIMS).,,,,,,,,
,"Source: OSSE audited enrollment of grades, SY14-15",,,,,,,,
,"1 Total building enrollment includes all grades in the facility, which can include more than 6-8 grades. ",,,,,,,,
,"2 PCS programmatic capacity reflects the maximum number of students that can be housed at the school building given the schools’ existing educational programs, class size, and staffing. PCS program capacities were self-reported by each public charter LEA in a survey for SY15-16 administered by PCSB and developed in partnership with the DME. The response rate for the program capacity survey question was 94%. ",,,,,,,,
,3 One student was mis-attributed to KIPP College Prep in the October 2014 OSSE Audited Enrollment file and was added to the KIPP Key Academy enrollment count.,,,,,,,,
,*PCSB inputted the program capacity for the schools that did not respond by taking  125% of the school's SY2014-15 audited enrollment. ,,,,,,,,
,"**In order to approximate SY14-15 programmatic capacities, there were instances where SY2015-16 self-reported program capacities could not be used because the school moved building locations between SY2014-15 and SY2015-16 or closed entirely in SY2015-16. In these instances, the DME used the school's 2014-15 audited enrollment figure as a proxy for program capacity for that SY14-15 building.",,,,,,,,
,***School recently completed renovations to the building that added space or acquired new space in the same building in SY15-16. ,,,,,,,,
