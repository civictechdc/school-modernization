1) * Indicates a charter school that serves adult population. Adult public schools have a different model for serving students compared to the traditional KG-12 public schools. Adult students attend school at different times of the day, in shifts. Thus, the total enrollment number for the school doesn't represent how many students occupy the building all at once, and instead represent how many students attend school in the building.  Briya is primarily adult but includes a small portion of PK3 and PK4 students who attend school simultaneously with their parents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) LEA ID(s), School ID(s), School Name(s) reported by OSSE via School and Lea Information Management System file (SLIMS).
2) School addresses and former DCPS facility names were verified by DME and PCSB.
3) Maximum occupancy numbers and total square footage numbers reported by PSCB. This information is collected through charter school facilities' Certificate of Occupancy (C of O), which charter schools are required to submit to PCSB in October if one is not already on file. PCSB then follows up with any missing charter facility C's of O between October-February of each year.  The maximum occupancy count number describes how many people can legally occupy the building stated on the facility's C of O. 
4) SY14-15 Audited enrollment, informed by OSSE. 
5) LEA enrollment ceiling is reported by PCSB. This number is set by a school's Charter Agreement and subsequent amendments, which state the maximum number of students for which a school receives payment.  Please note, Charters may submit written requests to DC PCSB Board to increase the maximum enrollment of the school. The DC PCSB Board reviews the charter school using a set of criteria, prior to voting, to approve or not approve the request. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
