<h2>DCPS digs out: $1 billion to stabilize neglected DCPS facilities</h2><br />
<div class="dig-out-text column col-md-11" id="main-content">
  <p>In 1995, DCPS facilities were an average of 65 years old with $1.2 billion (adjusted to reflect 2015 inflation) of deferred maintenance and repairsâ€”lead in water and paint; asbestos in flooring, walls, and insulation; leaking roofs; fire code violations throughout facilities; and air quality and indoor environmental health and safety problems.</p>
  <br />
  <p>From FY1998 to FY2015, hundreds of capital projects were completed to make DCPS buildings and grounds healthy and safe and to down-size the DCPS schools inventory in response to city population and enrollment decline.</p><br />
