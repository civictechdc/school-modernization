<h2>Funding a Growing Charter Sector: Charter Facilities Allowance Add-on</h2>

<p>
Starting in 1999 the city provided a per-student appropriation to ensure charter school students could be in adequate facilities.  The <b>Facilities Allowance add-on</b> is for leasing or purchasing buildings and capital construction.  Costs for facilities cleaning, utilities, maintenance and minor repairs are already included in the per student funding formula.

From 1999 - 2015, charter operators (private governed non-profits) received a total of $977 million from the city in school facilities allowance add-ons.  Currently this is $3,124 annually per day student and $8,395 for residential students.
