<ul>
  <li>Facilities Allowance add-ons can be used for any purpose, so the total may not have been spent for leasing or capital facilities’ purposes.
  <li>Charters may also use their annual per-student operating support (UPSFF Uniform Per-Student Formula Funding) and their Facilities Allowance add-ons to borrow money.  
  <li>26 charter operators have used the DC revenue bond program, together borrowing $650 million for acquisition and school construction through 2014. 
  <li>Charters may also borrow privately for capital projects.  This analysis does do not included charter borrowing and debt—only the appropriation for the facilities allowance add-on.
